# How far are we from solving the 2D \& 3D Face Alignment problem? (and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks)

This repository implements a demo of the networks described in "How far are we from solving the 2D \& 3D Face Alignment problem? (and a dataset of 230,000 3D facial landmarks)" paper. Please visit [our](https://www.adrianbulat.com) webpage or read bellow for instructions on how to run the code and access the dataset.

**Training code: <https://www.github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment-training>**

**:fire: Python code available: <https://www.github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment>**

Note: If you are interested in a binarized version, capable of running on devices with limited resources please also check <https://github.com/1adrianb/binary-face-alignment> for a demo.

## Requirments

- Install the latest [Torch7](http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html) version (for Windows, please follow the instructions available [here](https://github.com/torch/distro/blob/master/win-files/README.md))
- Install python 2.7.x

### Lua packages

- [cutorch](https://github.com/torch/cutorch)
- [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)
- [cunn](https://github.com/torch/cunn)
- [nngraph](https://github.com/torch/nngraph)
- [cudnn](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch)
- [xlua](https://github.com/torch/xlua)
- [image](https://github.com/torch/image)
- [paths](https://github.com/torch/paths)
- [fb.python](https://github.com/facebook/fblualib/blob/master/fblualib/python/README.md)

Note: if you are having troubles compiling thpp (required for fb.python) against the latest version of torch7 please use the version available here: [https://github.com/1adrianb/thpp](https://github.com/1adrianb/thpp)

### Python packages

- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [dlib](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dlib) (required for face detection, if no bbox are provided)

Please note that dlib performs poorly for faces found in challenging poses or difficult lighting conditions and it's provided only as a simple demo. For optimal performance we recommend using other deeplearning based face detection methods.

## Setup

Clone the github repository and install all the dependencies mentiones above.

```bash
git  clone https://github.com/1adrianb/2D-and-3D-face-alignment
cd 2D-and-3D-face-alignment
```

## Usage

In order to run the demo please download the required models available bellow and the associated data.

```bash
th main.lua
```

In order to see all the available options please run:

```bash
th main.lua --help
```

## Docker image

For convenience, a Dockerfile is provided to build images with cuda support and cudnn v5.1:

```bash
docker build -t facealignment .
```

Alternatively you can use the image available on [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/1adrianb/facealignment-torch/):

```bash
nvidia-docker run -it 1adrianb/facealignment-torch
```

In order to keep the image small the data and the models are not included and will have to be downloaded separately.

Docker image based on the [cuda-torch](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaixhin/cuda-torch/) by kaixhin.

## Pretrained models
